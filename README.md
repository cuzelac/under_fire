# UnderFire

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/under_fire.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/under_fire)

Wraps Gracenote's Web API in Ruby goodness. UnderFire provides two interfaces: a client to use from your projects and a command line interface.

## Installation

```ruby
gem install under_fire
```
or in your gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'under_fire'

```
## Registration

Before using UnderFire, you need to obtain a `client_id` and `user_id` from Gracenote as described below.

### Obtain client_id

-To obtain a client_id, visit http://developer.gracenote.com and register yourself for a developer account. Once your account is created, go to "My Apps" and create a new app. Finaly, open your new app from your My Apps page to obtain your "Client ID for Mobile Client, Web API, and eyeQ".

-Now on your computer you need to add your `client_id` to your environment. On OSX or Linux you can do this by adding the following line to your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` or wherever you prefer to set your environment variables:

```shell
export GRACENOTE_CLIENT_ID=your-client_id-here

```
After doing this, open a new terminal or type the following at the command prompt:

```
source ~/.bashrc

```
or

```
source ~/.zshrc

```

To test this out type the following in your terinal:

```
echo $GRACENOTE_CLIENT_ID

``` 

### Obtain user_id

-Now you're ready to use UnderFire's register task to obtain your `user_id`. At the command prompt, type:

```
under-fire register -c `echo $GRACENOTE_CLIENT_ID`

```
Copy your `user_id` from the output and add to your environment by entering the folloing in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` as you did with your `client_id` above:

```shell
export GRACENOTE_USER_ID=your-user_id-here

```
Once again, ensure that your current environment is up to date by opening a new terminal or sourcing the appropriate config file.

Now you're ready to get started.

## Usage

### Command line

UnderFire provides a command line interface (CLI) that makes it easy to explore the Gracenote Web API or combine with other UNIX tools in shell scripts. If you followed the registration instructions above, you've already used the CLI's registration task.

Here are some other things you can do:

Look up the album called "Armed Forces":

```
under-fire album -t "Armed Forces"

```


Look up "Armed Forces", fetch its cover art, and save it as "armed-forces.jpg in the current folder:

```
under-fire album -t "Armed Forces" | grep url | awk '{ print $2 }' | xargs under-fire cover -f "armed-forces.jpg" -u

```
For more information:

```
under-fire -h

```
If you want to search by a cd's table of contents, you need to provide the offset for each track on a given CD. To make things easy, I wrote a little gem called `cdtoc`. Just install this in the usual way:

```
gem install cdtoc

```

Then:

```
  $ cdtoc | xargs under-fire -o

```

### Programming API

If you're familiar with the Gracenote API, you'll note that I have renamed the commands to make it easier to differentiate between them and to stay with idiomatic Ruby. So, for example, Gracenote's "ALBUM_SEARCH" is called `find_album`.

All requests, with the exception of `fetch_cover`, return an APIResponse class, which provides `to_h` and `to_s` methods. You will probably find the `to_h` method most convenient.

```ruby

require 'under_fire/client'

# First, get a client instance
client = UnderFire::Client.new

# Search by track title
client.find_album(:track_title => 'Paranoid Android')

# or use either SINGLE_BEST or SINGLE_BEST_COVER
# SINGLE_BEST: returns the single best result as decided by Gracenote.
# SINGLE_BEST_COVER: same as above, but also returns cover URL. Currently this is the default.

album = client.find_album(:track_title => 'Paranoid Android', :mode => 'SINGLE_BEST')

# use query response to fetch the album cover.
client.fetch_cover(album, "OK_Computer_cover.jpg")

# The following searches by Gracenote album id or track id:
album = client.fetch_album(:gn_id => '86372321-2C7F28ADC369EB90E53A7F6CA3A70D56')

# If you want to limit your response to one album, use one of the two modes described above.

```

## Roadmap

More convenient APIResponse class that wraps artists and albums in their own classes.
